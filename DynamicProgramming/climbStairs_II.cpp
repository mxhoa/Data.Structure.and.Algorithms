 * @brief Climb Stairs II
 * 
 * There's a staircase with N steps, and you can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. 
 * Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. 
 * The order of the steps matters.
 * 
 * For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:
 *      1, 1, 1, 1
 *      2, 1, 1
 *      1, 2, 1
 *      1, 1, 2
 *      2, 2
 * 
 * What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from 
 * a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time. 
 * Generalize your function to take in X.

/**
 * Solution
 * It's always good to start off with some test cases. Let's start with small cases and see if we 
 * can find some sort of pattern.
 * 
 *      - N = 1: [1]
 *      - N = 2: [1, 1], [2]
 *      - N = 3: [1, 2], [1, 1, 1], [2, 1]
 *      - N = 4: [1, 1, 2], [2, 2], [1, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 1, 1]
 * 
 * What's the relationship?
 * 
 * The only ways to get to N = 3, is to first get to N = 1, and then go up by 2 steps, or get to N = 2 
 * and go up by 1 step. So f(3) = f(2) + f(1).
 * 
 * Does this hold for N = 4? Yes, it does. Since we can only get to the 4th step by getting to the 3rd step
 * and going up by one, or by getting to the 2nd step and going up by two. So f(4) = f(3) + f(2).
 * 
 * To generalize, f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2). That's just the Fibonacci sequence!
 *
 *  Time Complexity: O(2^N)
 *  Space Complexity: O(N)
