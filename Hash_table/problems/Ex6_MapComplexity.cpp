/* 
 * 
 * 6. Pick two data structures to use in implementing a Map. 
 * Describe lookup, insert, & delete operations. Give time & Space Complexity for each. 
 * Give pros & cons for each.
 * 
 * Hint:-
 *  a) Linked List
 *       I. Insert is O(1)
 *       II. Delete is O(1)
 *       III. Lookup is O(1) auxiliary and O(N) worst case.
 *       IV. Pros: Fast inserts and deletes, can use for any data type.
 *       V. Cons: Slow lookups.
 *  b) Balanced Search Tree (RB Tree)
 *       I. Insert is O(logn)
 *       II. Delete is O(logn)
 *       III. Lookup is O(logn)
 *       IV. Pros: Reasonably fast inserts/deletes and lookups.
 *       V. Cons: Data needs to have order defined on it.
